Do you sell digital ads for your website? There's one surefire way to impress potential
advertising clients in sales meetings: Show them something new and cool. 

That's what this plugin does. The underlying service, ParkAve, has free options and is used by hundreds
of successful news and magazine publishers.

== Description ==

This plugin is not affiliated with the popular and useful AdRotate plugin in any way — it simply adds a great ad builder on top of it.

Note: If you have an adblocker installed, it will prevent this tool (and parts of Wordpress) from working properly.

* Impress more sales clients *at* the sales meeting by creating an attractive sample ad
* Deliver great campaigns — better ad formats leads to more clicks
* Retain business — once you're using this tool to build great ads, your client won't want to work with anyone else

== Troubleshooting ==

This is a very simple plugin. If you are having trouble
loading ads on your site, please make sure that:

* You do not have an ad blocker installed (you would be amazed how often this happens). Disable it and refresh the page a few times to see if the ad appears.
* You don't have CSS in your theme which is hiding images (rare, but it happens)

If you have any other trouble, email kenny@broadstreetads.com - try to avoid
the Wordpress support forums because it's not always easy to get to problems right away there.

== Installation ==

First: Turn off any ad blockers you might have installed. They prevent
ads from appearing!

Other than that, there aren't any special instructions for installing this plug-in.
Watch the video demo and crate an ad in AdRotate to see the new ParkAve options.
